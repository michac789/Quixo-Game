Questions to be asked

1.
Can we declare global variable n for the dimension of the game?
It will be more efficient, but the problem is testing files (which might be used to check our function) might not work (such as test.py)

2.
Is there a board size limit? Let us say the minimum is 2, and maybe there should be a maximum size?
Letting the user input a tremendous board size such as 1000 could cause the program to crash! And it is not reasonable to do that anyway.

3.
Can we use some common libraries such as:
'random' to generate random number
'math' to generate some mathematical operations
'sys' to be able to exit (we might not need this again later)

4.
what kind of user interface to use? tkinter? can we seperate the code?
